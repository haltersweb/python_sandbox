    "# Project: Wheel of Fortune\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will take you through the process of implementing a simplified version of the game Wheel of Fortune. Here are the rules of our game:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are `num_human` __human players__ and `num_computer` __computer players__.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every player has some amount of money (\\$0 at the start of the game)\n",
    "* Every player has a set of prizes (none at the start of the game)\n",
    "\n",
    "### the goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The __goal__ is to __guess a phrase__ within a category. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Category: Artist & Song\n",
    "* Phrase: Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You\n",
    "\n",
    "Players see the category and an obscured version of the phrase where every alphanumeric character in the phrase starts out as hidden (using underscores: \\_):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Category: Artist & Song\n",
    "* Phrase: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_'\\_ \\_ \\_\\_\\_\\_ \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \\_\\_\\_\\_ \\_\\_\\_\n",
    "* Note that case (capitalization) does not matter\n",
    "\n",
    "### turn play\n",
    "\n",
    "During their turn, every player spins the wheel to determine a prize amount and:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### cash square\n",
    "\n",
    "If the wheel lands on a cash square, players may do one of three actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Guess any letter that hasn't been guessed by typing a letter (a-z)\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Vowels (a, e, i, o, u) cost \\$250 to guess and can't be guessed if the player doesn't have enough money. All other letters are \"free\" to guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The player can guess any letter that hasn’t been guessed and gets that cash amount for every time that letter appears in the phrase\n",
    "\n",
    "    * If there is a prize, the user also gets that prize (in addition to any prizes they already had)\n",
    "\n",
    "    * If the letter does appear in the phrase, the user keeps their turn. Otherwise, it’s the next player’s turn\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Example: The user lands on \\$500 ang guesses 'W' -- There are three Ws in the phrase, so the player wins 1,500.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Guess the complete phrase by typing a phrase (anything over one character that isn’t 'pass')\n",
    "\n",
    "    * If they are correct, they win the game\n",
    "\n",
    "    * If they are incorrect, it is the next player’s turn\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Pass their turn by entering 'pass'\n",
    "\n",
    "#### lose a turn\n",
    "\n",
    "If the wheel lands on \"lose a turn\", the player loses their turn and the game moves on to the next player\n",
    "\n",
    "#### bankrupt\n",
    "\n",
    "If the wheel lands on \"bankrupt\", the player loses their turn and loses their money but they keep all of the prizes they have won so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "### winning\n",
    "\n",
    "The game continues until the entire phrase is revealed or one player guesses the complete phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions / methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### build suspense with `time.sleep()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `time.sleep()` delays execution of the next line of code for s seconds. You’ll find that we can build a little suspense during gameplay with some well-placed delays. The game can also be easier for users to understand if not everything happens instantly."

    "\n",
    "Finally, we’re going to define a class named `WOFComputerPlayer`, which should inherit from `WOFPlayer` (part A). This class is going to represent a computer player.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every computer player will have a `difficulty` instance variable. Players with a higher `difficulty` generally play “better”. There are many ways to implement this. We’ll do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If there aren’t any possible letters to choose (for example: if the last character is a vowel but this player doesn’t have enough to guess a vowel), we’ll `'pass'`\n",
    "* __Otherwise, semi-randomly decide whether to make a “good” move or a “bad” move on a given turn (a higher difficulty should make it more likely for the player to make a “good” move)__\n",
    "    * To make a “bad” move, we’ll randomly decide on a possible letter.\n",
    "    * To make a “good” move, we’ll choose a letter according to their overall frequency in the English language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to having all of the instance variables and methods that `WOFPlayer` has, `WOFComputerPlayer` should have:\n",
    "\n",
    "### class variable\n",
    "\n",
    "`.SORTED_FREQUENCIES`: Should be set to `'ZQXJKVBPYGFWMUCLDRHSNIOATE'`, which is a list of English characters sorted from least frequent ('Z') to most frequent ('E'). We’ll use this when trying to make a “good” move.\n",
    "\n",
    "### additional instance variable\n",
    "\n",
    "`.difficulty`: The level of difficulty for this computer (should be passed as the __second argument__ into the __constructor__ after `.name`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### methods\n",
    "\n",
    "* `.smartCoinFlip()`: This method will help us decide semi-randomly whether to make a “good” or “bad” move. A higher difficulty should make us more likely to make a “good” move. Implement this by choosing a random number between `1` and `10` using `random.randint(1, 10)` (see above) and returning `False` if that random number is greater than `self.difficulty`. If the random number is less than or equal to `self.difficulty`, return `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `.getPossibleLetters(guessed)`: This method should __return a list of letters that can be guessed__.\n",
    "    * These should be characters that are in `LETTERS` (`'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`) but __not__ in the `guessed` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Additionally, if this player doesn’t have enough prize money to guess a vowel (variable `VOWEL_COST` set to `250`), then vowels (variable `VOWELS` set to `'AEIOU'`) should __not__ be included\n",
    "\n",
    "* `.getMove(category, obscuredPhrase, guessed)`: __Returns a valid move__ (__doesn't prompt__ of course).\n",
    "    * Use the `.getPossibleLetters(guessed)` method described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * If there aren’t any letters that can be guessed (this can happen if the only letters left to guess are vowels and the player doesn’t have enough for vowels), return `'pass'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Use the `.smartCoinFlip()` method to __decide whether to make a “good” or a “bad” move__.\n",
    "        * If making a “good” move (`.smartCoinFlip()` returns `True`), then return the most frequent (highest index in `.SORTED_FREQUENCIES`) possible character\n",
    "\n",
    "        * If making a “bad” move (`.smartCoinFlip()` returns `False`), then return a random character from the set of possible characters (use `random.choice()`)"
